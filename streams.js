//streams is also one of the most useful topic in node js
// this is used for tochange the text from one file to another file.
//it is also collection of data like array and strings.
//The difference is that it not stores all at once.
//example:
/*
if we want to store a file streams helps us to store in 
small chunks or parts of data.

streams works on a concept called buffer.

buffer ---> a buffer is a temporary memory.
